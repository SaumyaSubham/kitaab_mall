# book_recommendation_knn
 This is a project of Machine Learning which is created by using kNN.

First of All Welcome Everyone!

In this project, We will create a book recommendation algorithm using K-Nearest Neighbors.

We will use the Book-Crossings dataset. This dataset contains 1.1 million ratings (scale of 1-10) of 270,000 books by 90,000 users.

After importing and cleaning the data, use NearestNeighbors from sklearn.neighbors to develop a model that shows books that are similar to a given book. The Nearest Neighbors algorithm measures distance to determine the “closeness” of instances.
